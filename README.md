# CodeJam2020
This repository contains my solutions for CodeJam's `Vestigium`, `Nesting Depth`, and `Parenting Partnering Returns` problems.


The programs read line by line from standard input, but for convinience I will include the sample cases as files for each question.

Adding `file = open("<filename>")` and replacing all instances of `sys.stdin` with `file` will help you read testcases from the file 
instead of entering them into the terminal.
